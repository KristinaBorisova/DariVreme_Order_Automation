# 🔧 GitHub Actions Fixes Applied

## 🚨 Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: Wrong TOKEN_URL
**Problem**: The workflow was using `https://stageapi.glovoapp.com/v2/laas/oauth/token` but the correct URL is `https://stageapi.glovoapp.com/oauth/token`

**Fix**: Updated the workflow to use the correct URL.

### Issue 2: Environment Variables Not Set
**Problem**: `GOOGLE_SHEETS_URL` was empty in the logs.

**Fix**: Added debugging and verification steps to the workflow.

### Issue 3: Hardcoded Credentials
**Problem**: Token service was using hardcoded credentials instead of environment variables.

**Fix**: Updated token service to use environment variables with fallback to hardcoded values.

## 📋 Changes Made

### 1. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow
- Fixed TOKEN_URL to use correct endpoint
- Added environment variable debugging
- Added test step for environment variables

### 2. Updated Token Service
- Modified to use environment variables when available
- Added debugging output for troubleshooting
- Kept hardcoded values as fallback

### 3. Created Test Scripts
- `test_env_vars.py` - Test environment variables
- `GITHUB_ACTIONS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Troubleshooting guide

## 🎯 What You Need to Do

### 1. Update GitHub Secrets
Go to your repository → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**

**Required Secrets:**
- `API_KEY`: `175482686405285`
- `API_SECRET`: `dc190e6d0e4f4fc79e4021e4b981e596`
- `GOOGLE_SHEETS_URL`: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OjOkAol3vXCbk-QPGioUAJnQgPs3t9HQ/edit?gid=519498004#gid=519498004`

**Note**: `TOKEN_URL` is now hardcoded in the workflow, so you don't need to set it as a secret.

### 2. Push the Fixes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix GitHub Actions environment variables and token URL"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Test the Workflow
1. Go to **Actions** → **Daily Delivery Automation**
2. Click **"Run workflow"**
3. Select **"Run in test mode (dry run)"**
4. Click **"Run workflow"**

## 🔍 What to Look For

### Successful Run Should Show:
```
Environment variables set successfully
TOKEN_URL: https://stageapi.glovoapp.com/oauth/token
API_KEY is set: true
API_SECRET is set: true
GOOGLE_SHEETS_URL is set: true
```

### Test Environment Variables Should Show:
```
✅ TOKEN_URL: https://stageapi.glovoapp.com/oauth/token
✅ API_KEY: 17548268...
✅ API_SECRET: dc190e6d...
✅ GOOGLE_SHEETS_URL: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/...
```

### Authentication Should Show:
```
🔑 Fetching token from: https://stageapi.glovoapp.com/oauth/token
🔑 Using API Key: 17548268...
✅ Successfully got token: eyJraWQiOi...
```

## 🚨 If It Still Fails

### Check These:

1. **Secrets are set correctly**:
   - Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Verify all 3 secrets are present and have correct values

2. **Google Sheets is accessible**:
   - Test the URL in your browser
   - Ensure the sheet is publicly accessible

3. **API credentials are valid**:
   - Test locally: `cd step_1_authentication && python token_service.py`

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Test locally
python test_env_vars.py
python test_github_actions.py
python test_weekday_automation.py
```

## 📊 Expected Results

After the fixes, your workflow should:

1. ✅ Set all environment variables correctly
2. ✅ Authenticate with Glovo API successfully
3. ✅ Load data from Google Sheets
4. ✅ Process orders based on delivery frequency
5. ✅ Create quotes and orders via API
6. ✅ Save logs and results

## 🎉 Success!

Once the workflow runs successfully, your daily delivery automation will:

- Run automatically every weekday at 9:00 AM UTC
- Process orders based on delivery frequency (3 or 5)
- Create quotes and orders via Glovo API
- Log all activities and results
- Handle errors gracefully

**🎯 The main issue was the wrong TOKEN_URL. With the correct URL and proper environment variable setup, your workflow should now work!**
